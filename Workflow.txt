1. Fork and Git clone
2. Ran basic commands mentioned in the README.md

    ALTERNATIVE
    -----------
    3.1. Ran it via docker since it is compatiable with Gunicorn.
    3.2. Made a Dockerfile and created a docker image.
    3.3. Used the image to create a contaier via docker-compose file.
    3.4. Still couldn't work around with bash file and started having inconsistancy with the db migrations.

4. Decided to ran it simply via creating an environment valiable and exported the Flask application instance. 
5. flask run.

Bugs List:
---------
1. Any student can update any assignment in the draft category.
2. Null/empty content can be stored. 
    2.1. Changing it in models to (nullable=Flase) will create issues in migrations as there are already some of the 
        Null content present which is graded and cannot be updated now.
3. Can submit/resubmit an assignment with any category (Draft, submitted, gradded)
4. Teacher can view all the assignment including not assigned to anyone.

6. Principal can grade any assignment even when no teacher is assigned (Not solved since not sure what to assign)
7. Principal can grade assignment even in draft category.
